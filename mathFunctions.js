// This first example should set you on the right path

//Create a function that will return the sum of two numbers

function sum(a, b) {

// Complete the remaining functions, then run the unit tests to see if they pass

// Create a function that will return the difference of two numbers

function subtract(a,b) {
  
}

// You want to divide your class into groups of four. 
// You will have a group that is less than four students.
